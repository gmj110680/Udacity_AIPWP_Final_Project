# Udacity AI Programming With Python Course Final Project

_Summary_

This is a 102-category flower image classifier that I built as my final project for the Udacity AI Programming With Python Course.  For part 1 of the project, I created a Jupyter notebook file that pre-processes and divides the images dataset into training and test sets, trains a model, saves the trained model into a checkpoint file, and then validates the accuracy of the trained model. That portion of the project is saved in the Image_Classifier_Project.html file.

For part 2 of the project, I created command-line compatible python files to allow a user to train an image classifier model and then use the trained model to classify new images.  The train.py file allows the user to select certain features and train the model.  The predict.py file allows the user to select a trained image classifier model to classify a new image.
